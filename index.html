                    Hello reader! My name is Valentina. I was born in Colombia in the late 90s and, for good reason, came to the United States at a very young age. I spent most of my childhood enjoying the sunny beaches of Hollywood Florida. I dedicated most of my time to school, of course, and at synchronized swimming practice. I was a part of the Aquacades traveling swim team, who still train out of the Coral Springs Aquatic Complex in Coral Springs, for seven years. Those were some of the best years of my life. I owe a lot my teamwork skills and communication to the sport and my teammates. I had to learn be very disciplined and active at a young age to be able to support my teammates, whether that means helping them with details about the routine or emotional support. I continue to apply those skills as an adult and in my professional life. I enjoy helping someone conquer a challenge they are facing or make suggestions that might help the effectiveness of a project.
                    I moved to New Jersey just before starting high school in 2009. I currently live with my boyfriend, Anthony, our poodle, Chloe, and our cat, Bean. Anthony and I both enjoy outdoor activities and being a part of our local Jiu Jitsu community at Radji Barret Jiu Jitsu in Edison. It has been a great experience trying something new, aside from learning Web Development! Overall, I like to stay active and engage people in communities that share the same mindset: strive to be the best you can be!
