                    <strong>Hello reader!</strong> My name is Valentina. I was born in Colombia in the mid 90s and came
                    to the sunny beaches of Hollywood, Florida. I dedicated most of my time to school and synchronized
                    swimming practice. I was a part of the Aquacades traveling team, that continue to train out of the
                    Coral Springs Aquatic Complex, for seven years. Those were some of the best years of my life. I owe
                    a lot my teamwork skills and communication to the sport and my teammates. I learned to be
                    disciplined and organized at a very young age. I continue to apply those skills as an adult and in
                    my professional life. I enjoy helping someone conquer a challenge they are facing or make
                    suggestions that might help the effectiveness of a task.
                    I moved to New Jersey just before starting high school in 2009. I currently live with my boyfriend,
                    Anthony, our poodle Chloe, and our cat Bean. Anthony and I both enjoy outdoor activities and being a
                    part of our local Jiu Jitsu community at Radji Barret Jiu Jitsu in Edison. It has been a great
                    experience trying something new, aside from learning Web Development! Overall, I like to stay active
                    and engage people in communities that share the same mindset: strive to be the best you can be!

                        <p>This is the first project I built alone before beginning my full-stax coding bootcamp with
                            Rutgers University. It's fun to see how much i've learned in a such a short amount of time.

                        <p>This project features a starter code given by the Rutgers Bootcamp teaching administration.
                            It challanged our ability to apply the DRY (Do Not Repeat) method to the CSS style sheet and
                            to make the viewport into a responsive layout that caters to users that have different
                            screen types. </p>
